PON1 activity was determined using paraoxon as a substrate and measured by increases in the absorbance at 412nm due to the formation of 4-nitrophenol.
For the same purified PON1 protein concentration, PON1 in the elderly group presents a lower  activity (303.05 U/mg) compared to young group (485.61 U/mg).
There is a close association between the antioxidant activity of PON1 and the number of free SH groups contained within PON1, which suggests that the loss of the antioxidant activity of the PON1 might be due to an alteration of the number of free thiol groups within PON1.
Free sulfhydryl ( SH) groups contained in PON1 were measured using the 2,2- dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) method.
Quantitative titration of the purified PON1 confirmed the presence of a unique free sulfhydryl group in the young group and a significant decrease in the number of PON1’s sulfhydryl groups in the elderly (p < 0.0092).
