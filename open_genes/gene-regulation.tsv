To investigate whether VHL was transcriptionally regulated by FOXO3a, promoter assays was undertaken and one potential FOXO-DNA binding element (DBE) at position -567 to -561 (TTGTTAC) in VHL promoter was identified. Pair of primers that could amplify a fragment encompassing the potential FOXO-DNA binding element (DBE) was designed, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using
anti-FOXO3a antibody was performed. Further semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays validated this binding ability of FOXO3a. 
Subsequently,  the induction of VHL by FOXO3a in the inducible HEK293T cell line was we determined and a 5-fold increase in VHL mRNA was observed (semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR). The induction of pVHL protein by activating FOXO3a was further verified (Western blot).
