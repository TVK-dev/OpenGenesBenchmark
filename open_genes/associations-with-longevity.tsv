Researchers determined the association between Ala allele and development of cognitive decline (3MS decline of ≥ 5 points).
At baseline, unadjusted scores on both cognitive tests were higher for Ala carriers compared to non-carriers (3MS, 94.2 vs 92.5, p<0.001; DSST, 40.2 vs 34.5, p<0.001).

Maximum follow-up was 23.5 years; of the 84.6% participants with at least one visit beyond visit 2, the median follow-up time was 19.2 (interquartile range, 6.0–21.0) years. 
Delayed Word Recall (DWRT), Digit Symbol Substitution (DSST), and word fluency (WFT) tests were used to assess cognitive performance and were summarized with a global Z-score. 
 Among the black males, there was a significantly greater rate of cognitive decline in the global Z-score among Ala12+ black males compared to Ala12- black males (−0.92 SD decline vs −0.57 SD). . There was no association of Ala12 carrier status with the rate of cognitive decline among black females, white males, or white females for any of the cognitive tests, with or without covariate adjustment.
