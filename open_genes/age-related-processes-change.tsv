other genotypes, as indicated by a better glucose uptake following glucose injection (p < 0.05 in both cases). The onset of a large variety of age-related pathologies, mostly atrophies and inflammatory processes, was also significantly delayed in Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice, compared with the Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p < 0.05 in both cases). Coincidental with higher telomerase activity in TgTert mice,it was observed significantly longer telomeres and a lower percentage of short telomeres in  the skin.
 A recently described molecular marker of aging is the accumulation of phosphorylated histone H2AX (g-H2AX) foci in aged tissues, which is thought to reflect the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks, including those derived from critically short/dysfunctional telomeres. Aging-dependent increase in g H2AX foci was significantly attenuated by the presence of TgTert in the Sp53/TgTert and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mouse cohorts compared with both wild-type mice and to their corresponding Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls.
 TgTert expressing mice have a decreased incidence of degenerative inflammatory pathologies (Sp53 background and Sp53/Sp16/SArf background; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08, respectively. The tightrope test performance was significantly improved in Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert mice at >1 years of age, compared with agematched wild-type and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p < 0.05 for both comparisons). The thinning of the subcutaneous adipose layer is a known aging-associated morphological feature, which, in turn, is associated with increased risk of skin injuries and infections. Aged Sp53/TgTert and Sp53/Sp16/SArf/ TgTert mice showed a better preservation of both the thickness of the epidermis and of the subcutaneous fat layer compared to their corresponding Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/SArf controls (p < 0.05 for all comparisons)."

Drebrin protein expression in the hippocampus correlated with behavioral performance in different aged AD mice.
When a vector with the DBN1 gene was injected into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, an increase in drebrin expression correlated with an improvement in cognitive abilities and a decrease in amyloid plaques and brain damage. Also, in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice, the level of filamentous actin (F-actin)  and the protein MAP-2 (a protein associated with microtubules) was increased in the hippocampus.

Third generation mTR−/− mice (G3) possess shortened telomeres early in life but, at this point, appear to be phenotypically normal in every respect.
Telomeres shorten during the lifetime of aging humans, but there is no direct correlation between the telomere length and the life span of different species (e.g., between mouse and humans) or within species of mice. A dramatic increase in the incidence of hair graying and alopecia (hair loss) was noted in aging G3(third generation mice) and G6 (sixth generation mice) compared to age-matched mTR+/+ mice ( 25% in mTR+/+, 54% in G3, and 60% in G6, in animals older than 15 months). In addition, hair graying was seen at younger ages: some of the G6 animals showed graying at 6 months of age, while none of the G3 or mTR+/+ mice showed alopecia or hair graying at this age. 
The onset of skin ulcerations was earlier in life in G6 compared to mTR+/+ and G3 animals (average age: 25 months in mTR+/+, 26 months in G3, and 15 months in G6).  Histologically, the skin lesions appeared as ulcerations with epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and underlying dermal fibrosis.

Higher progenitor proliferation rate, along with a delay in gliogenesis, is also observed in Gdf11(-/-) spinal cord but only after the peak of Gdf11 expression, indicating that Gdf11 can cause long-lasting changes in progenitor properties. These changes can be preserved in vitro, as neurospheres derived from Gdf11(-/-) and wild-type littermates at a stage after, but not before the onset of Gdf11 expression, exhibit differences in proliferation and differentiation potential. Moreover, these changes in progenitor properties can be induced in vitro by the addition of Gdf11. The effects of Gdf11 on progenitor cells are associated with its ability to upregulate p57(Kip2) and p27(Kip1) while downregulating Pax6 expression. These results support a model in which Gdf11 secreted by newly born neurons in the developing spinal cord facilitates the temporal progression of neurogenesis by acting as a positive feedback signal on the progenitor cells to promote cell cycle exit and decrease proliferation ability, thus changing their differentiation potential."

A reciprocal transplantation approach revealed a cell-intrinsic defect in early B-cell precursors caused by Wip1 deficiency. Further experiments revealed that Wip1 deficiency led to a sustained activation of p53 in B cells, which led to increased level of apoptosis in the pre-B-cell compartment. Moreover, Wip1 deficiency exacerbated a decline in B-cell development caused by aging as evidenced in mice with aging and mouse models with serial competitive bone marrow transplantation, respectively.

This promoter controls the expression of the transgene NRG1-EGFP in one direction and the reporter gene LacZ in another direction. Eight transgenic lines were obtained and crossed to one transgenic line with the tTA transgene under the control of a calcium/calmodulin kinase II promoter (CamKIIα-tTA). Expression of the marker gene, LacZ, was found in SGNs of the cochlea, and this expression could be controlled by the administration of doxycycline in the drinking water. Doxycycline was withdrawn at two months of age to induce NRG1 over-expression in the “Turned-On” group. The expression level of type-III NRG1 was 0.43 ± 0.1(10−4) for the control, 0.56 ± 0.1 (10−4) for the “Turned-Off” mice, and 0.91 ± 0.1(10−4) for the “Turned-On” mice. ABR (auditory brainstem response) measurements showed a moderate but significant reduction of hearing loss for the “Turned-On” group. NRG1 over-expression was then “turned-off” by application of dox (Turned-On-Off). After two weeks of dox administration, the improvement of ABR thresholds dramatically disappeared. The data were consistent with that NRG1 improved the hearing thresholds by enhancing synaptic transmission between hair cells and SGNs similar to its function at the neuromuscular junction. Mice over-expressing NRG1 showed significantly more missing IHCs (inner hair cell) cells (p = 0.006). Thus, NRG1 over-expression during aging failed to protect SGNs (spiral ganglion neurons) and was toxic to IHCs.

Translation into LIP depends on a cis-regulatory uORF and is stimulated by mTORC1 signalling.
In the present experiment reduction of LIP expression by genetic ablation of the uORF in C/EBPβΔuORF knockin mice is associated with improved metabolic profile.
The data demonstrated that both visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes were clearly reduced in knockout mice compared to age- and sex-matched littermate controls. Histological analyses of epididymal fat pads revealed an average reduction of white adipocyte cell size of 30% in knockout male mice compared to wt control tissue. In accordance with the lower fat content of knockout mice adipocytes, adiponectin levels were increased comparing to controls. Knockout mice have a moderate but significant daily increase in fatty acid oxidation over carbohydrate oxidation under normal feeding conditions. Furthermore, oxygen consumption of the knockout mice was increased compared to wt mice, indicating that the knockout mice have a higher energy expenditure. In the serum of knockout mice, the concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) was reduced compared to wt mice. Furthermore, lipid accumulation in liver and heart was strongly reduced in 8-month-old C/EBPβΔuORF/BL6 mice compared to wt littermates as revealed by Sudan III staining.

In 12-month-old mice, gp91ds-tat had no effect on resting CBF and responses to A23187, SNAP, adenosine, and hypercapnia, but it reversed the age-induced attenuation of the increases in CBF produced by functional hyperemia, acetylcholine, and bradykinin. In contrast, the scrambled peptide failed to reverse these alterations. gp91ds-tat, but not its scrambled control, blocked the increase in ROS observed in 12-month-old mice."
