#### **Supplemental Methods**

**Antibodies.** The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-SOD1 polyclonal (sc-11407, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); rabbit anti-SOD2 polyclonal (sc-30080, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); rabbit anti-SOD3 polyclonal (ab83108, Abcam Inc.); rabbit anti-Actin polyclonal (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-SOD2 (Acetylated-Lysine68) monoclonal (ab137037, Abcam Inc.); rabbit anti-SIRT3 monoclonal (5490, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-Acetyl K413 IDH2 (AC0004, GeneTel Lab.); rabbit anti-IDH2 polyclonal (sc-134923, Santa Cruz). The secondary antibodies were peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (31460, Thermo Scientific) and peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (31450, Thermo Scientific).

**Histology and Immunohistochemistry.** Immediately following death, rodent knee joints were harvested for histological evaluation. Rat joints were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 48 hrs and then decalcified for 7 days. Mouse joints were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hrs and then decalcified for 3 days. Following fixation, joints were paraffin-processed and 10-μm coronal sections from rats or 6-μm sagittal sections from mice were stained with hematoxylin, fast green, and Safranin-O. Two experienced blinded graders evaluated OA pathology in F344BN rats using a semi-quantitative histomorphometric scoring system (Table S1). Four sections throughout the medial and lateral femoral condyles and tibial plateau were scored and averaged for each limb, and left and right limbs were averaged per location. Medial and lateral compartments were averaged for meniscus and synovium pathology scores. For immunostaining, paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated with antigen retrieval R-Buffer A (EMS, 62706-10) at 60°C for 18 hours. Slides were then treated with 2% H2O<sup>2</sup> , blocked using 4% BSA and 5% donkey serum, and

incubated with a rabbit anti-SIRT3 monoclonal antibody (1:100) or anti-SOD2 polyclonal antibody (1:100) for 2 hrs at room temperature. Staining was detected using a Polink-2 Plus HRP Rabbit with AEC chromogen kit (GBI Labs, D40-18) following manufacturer's protocol, with one modification to extend antibody enhancer and HRP polymer incubation time to 15 min. AEC was not detected in parallel treated anti-rabbit IgG negative controls (1:100). Two

blinded graders conducted semi-quantitative scoring of SIRT3 staining intensity in the tibial and femoral articular cartilage (Table S1). Two blinded graders conducted semi-quantitative scoring of SOD2 immunostaining in knee cartilage sections from 10 and 30 month old animals. Two knee sections per animal (n=4 for 10 mo, n=4 for 30 mo) were scored for the intensity of SOD2 staining according to the following cellular staining intensity scale: 0 none, 1 - light, 2 - moderate, 3 - intense. We compared the intensity of staining to the amount of cartilage damage observed along the tibial plateaus or femoral condyles. We analyzed the data by sub-regions to look at the anatomical specificity of staining: the outer third (toward the collateral ligaments), the middle third (primary load bearing region), and inner third (toward the cruciate ligaments) for both medial and lateral compartments. The total sites of each staining type were counted. To determine the association between SOD2 staining and cartilage damage, each immuno-stained slide was compared with its adjacent histology slide. For this analysis, we defined cartilage pathology as proteoglycan loss only (no cartilage fibrilation or damage), cartilage surface fibrilation, or cartilage damage extending below the surface layer. We counted the sites where SOD2-positive chondrocytes were within or immediately adjacent to damaged locations and expressed data as a fraction of total sites evaluated.

Semi-quantitative histomorphometric scoring system for assessment of knee OA in F344BN rats and SIRT3 staining of C57BL/6J mice. Coronal histological sections from F344BN rat knees were stained with hematoxylin, fast green, and Safranin-O and evaluated by two experienced blinded graders. 4 sections were scored for and averaged within each of four locations for cartilage: lateral femur, lateral tibia, medial femur, and medial tibia. Meniscus and synovium scores were averaged from 3 sections throughout the joint. Osteophyte score was averaged from 2 sections throughout the joint. Left and right limbs scores were averaged per joint location. 0-3 osteophyte scoring system was based on a photomicrograph scale described by Kraus VB, Huebner JL, DeGroot J, Bendele A. The OARSI histopathology initiative - recommendations for histological assessments of osteoarthritis in the guinea pig. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage. 2010;18(S3):S35–S52. Semi-quantitative scoring of SIRT3 staining intensity was conducted by 2 blinded graders in the tibial and femoral articular cartilage.

Cartilage oxidative stress and antioxidant gene expression was measured by RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler Rat Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense Array (SABiosciences) using 200ng cDNA. Fold

regulation (relative to 10-mo), 95% CI and P values were analyzed using the program RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis version 3.4. Genes are ranked by positive to negative foldexpression changes. \*P < 0.05 versus 10-mo samples (n=4 per age).

**Figure S1. Reduced and oxidized glutathione content in adult and aged F344BN rat knee joint tissues. (A)** Articular cartilage reduced glutathione (GSH) content decreased nearly 50% between 10 to 30 mo of age. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and total glutathione (GSH+GSSG) content did not significantly change with age (n=3). Total glutathione content was approximately 5-fold greater in cartilage compared to meniscus and synoviuminfrapatellar fat pad (IFP) samples **(B)** Meniscus total glutathione content increased 21% with age due to non-significant increases in both GSH and GSSG (n=3). **(C)** Synovium-IFP glutathione content did not change with age (n=3). Bar values are the mean ± SEM. \*P < 0.05 and \*\*P < 0.01 versus 10-mo samples.

**Figure S2. Age-related increase in SOD2 expression is associated with cartilage damage.** Aging increased cartilage damage in F344BN rats primarily in the central region of the articular cartilage, herein described as the load bearing region. (**A)** 30-mo old rats developed greater levels of proteoglycan loss, surface fibrilation, and cartilage damage in the load bearing region compared to 10-mo old animals. **(B)** The intensity of light cellular SOD2 staining increased with age in the load bearing region (0=none, 1=light, 2=moderate, and 3=intense). **(C)** SOD2 staining in 10-mo old animals was not associated with the few sites of cartilage damage observed in panel A; whereas, >1/2 the areas of SOD2 staining were associated with cartilage pathology in 30-mo old animals, with a higher association of

SOD2 staining in regions with more severe cartilage pathology. (**D**) SOD2 staining intensity in histologically normal cartilage regions throughout the joint was similar between ages, with a slight increase in light SOD2 staining intensity in aged animals. Total counts include medial and lateral femur and tibia locations for 2 sections per animal and 4 animals per age.

**Figure S3. Western blot protein abundance and activity of SOD isoforms in cartilage from aging F344BN rats.** (**A)** Representative western blot images of rat cartilage cytosolic SOD (SOD1), mitochondrial SOD (SOD2), and extracellular SOD (SOD3) isolated from 10- and 30-mo old animals. **(B)** Densitometry analysis of SOD1 protein relative to the density of the first lane. (**C, D**) Adjusted density of SOD2 and SOD3 normalized to pairmatched SOD1 protein. Only SOD2 increased with age, consistent with a mitochondrialspecific response to age-related oxidative stress (n=6). **(E)** Knee cartilage total SOD enzyme activity normalized to total cartilage protein as determined by inhibition of xanthine oxidasemediated oxidation of Tetrazolium salt (n=6). **(F)** SOD1 and SOD3 activity as determined by KCN-sensitive inhibition of total SOD activity (n=6). Bar values are the mean ± SEM. \*P < 0.05 versus 10-mo samples.

**Figure S4. Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) acetylation increases with age in cartilage from F344BN rats.** (**A)** Representative western blot images of rat cartilage IDH2 acetylated K413, IDH2 and ACTIN isolated from the articular cartilage of 10-, 20- and 30-mo old animals. **(B)** Densitometry analysis of IDH2 and IDH2 acetylated K413. Adjusted density of IDH2 was normalized to pair-matched ACTIN protein. Adjusted density of IDH2 acetylated K413 was normalized to pair-matched IDH2 protein. Bar values are the mean ± SEM. \*P < 0.05 versus samples from 10-mo old animals.
