**Figure S10. AAV9-mTERT treatment protects from metabolic dysfunction**. **A**. Tissues from 2 yr old mice present a decrease of expression of genes involved in metabolism and mitochondrial function such as PGC-1α, ATP syn. and ERRα, a situation previously observed in aging induced by telomere shortening (Sahin et al, 2011). Treatment with mTERT late in life partially rescues this condition. Student´s t-test was used for statistical assessments.

## **Supplemental methods:**

#### **Mice**

Mice were produced at a specific pathogen-free barrier area of the CNIO, in accordance with the recommendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations. Mice were daily inspected by an authorized animal facility technician and sacrificed when they presented signs of morbidity or tumors in accordance to the Guidelines for Humane Endpoints for Animals Used in Biomedical Research (Harrison et al, 2009). The date of euthanasia was used as an estimation of the mouse lifespan. All mice were subjected to necropsy and histopathological analysis.

#### **Highthroughput Q-FISH (HT-QFISH) telomere length analysis on blood samples**

HT-QFISH was performed as described (Canela et al, 2007). Briefly, blood was extracted from the facial vein at the indicated time points after treatment and peripheral blood leukocytes plated in clear bottom black-walled 96-well plates. The 4`,6-diamidino-2 phenylindole channel was used for nucleus staining and the CY3 for telomere detection. Telomere length values were analyzed using individual telomere spots (> 5000 telomere spots per sample). Fluorescence intensities were converted into Kb using L5178-R and L5178-S cells as calibration standards, which have stable telomere lengths of 79.7 kb and 10.2 kb, respectively (McIlrath et al, 2001). Samples were analyzed in duplicate, or triplicate in the case of calibration standards.

## **Object recognition assay**

The object recognition memory test was carried out as explained before (Bevins & Besheer, 2006) and briefly explained in **Fig. S4h**. The plotted values correspond to the time spend in the "new object (object B)" divided by the total time spent with both objects (objects A and B).

## **Fat content**

Fat content was measured with the same procedure described for bone mineral density acquirements, using the DEXA scan.

#### **Quantitative real-time RT–PCR**

Total RNA from tissues was extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies). RNA samples were DNase I treated, and used as template for a reverse transcription reaction using random primers and Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems), using DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers used were: Actin-For: GGCACCACACCTTCTACAATG; Actin-Rev: GTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAG; TERT-For: GGATTGCCACTGGCTCCG; TERT-Rev: TGCCTGACCTCCTCTTGTGAC; Axin2-For: GGCAAAGTGGAGAGGATCGAC; Axin2-Rev: TCGTGGCTGTTGCGTAGG; CyclinD1 – For: TGCGCCCTCCGTATCTTAC; CyclinD1 – Rev: ATCTTAGAGGCCACGAACATGC; CD44 – For: CAGCCTACTGGAGATCAGGATGA; CD44 – Rev: GGAGTCCTTGGATGAGTCTCGA; p16-For: CGTACCCCGATTCAGGTGAT; p16- Rev: TTGAGCAGAAGAGCTGCTACGT. Target genes used in **Fig. S10** were done according to Sahin et al. (Sahin et al, 2011). Statistical analyses (student's t-test) were performed on the Ct values as described before (Munoz et al, 2005).

### **Western blots**

Western blots were made on whole cell extracts from the indicated tissues. Tissues from moribund animals were collected and immediately snap frozen post-mortem. The antibodies used were: Anti-h/mTERT [Calbiochem, 582005; the specificity of this antibody was previously tested by us using negative and positive controls in (Martinez et al); and further confirmed in this manuscript (**Fig. S2**), anti-β-Catenin (BD Laboratories, 610154), anti-Activeβ-Catenin (Millipore, 05-665), anti-Axin2 (Abcam, 32197), anti-p16 (Santa Cruz, 1207), anti-βActin (Sigma, A5441) and anti-GAPDH (Sigma, G8795). The quantification was made with Scion Image Software.

### **Histological analysis and immunohistochemistry**

Histopathology was performed as previously described (Gonzalez-Suarez et al, 2001). Briefly, mouse tissues and organs were fixed overnight in a 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution at 4°C, dehydrated through graded alcohols and xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Histological analysis was performed on 4-5 µm sections according to standard procedures. Cancer related pathologies were grouped in four types as described (Tomas-Loba et al, 2008). Degenerative and inflammatory pathologies have been scored using the same criteria previously described (Tomas-Loba et al, 2008). In summary, degenerative and inflammatory pathologies include: severe infections (GI tract: enteritis, gastritis, peritonitis; Skin: dermatitis), degenerative lesions of the GI tract (muscular atrophy and associated lesions (peritonitis, enteritis)), other degenerative pathologies related to normal aging (benign neoplasias (adenoma, hemangioma, lipoma) or degenerative lesions in the intestine (atrophy of the small and large intestine), kidney (glomerulonephritis, tubular degeneration), spleen (atrophy, hemosiderosis, myeloid and lymphoid hyperplasia), liver (congestion, vacuolar degeneration, microgranuloma), testis (atrophy, ectasis of seminal vesicles), ovary (atrophy), uterus (cystic endometrial hyperplasia), skin (hyperplasias, inflammatory processes), lung (trombosis, congestion, fibrosis), heart (congestion, cardiomyopathy) or brain (calcification)).

Immunohistochemistry was performed on deparaffinated tissues and processed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or the indicated antibodies: Anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A11122), Anti-cyclinD1 (Thermo Scientific, RM-9104, Clone SP4), Anti-Phospho-Smad2 (SER465/467, Chemicon AB3849) and Anti Ki-67 (DakoCytomation, M7249, clone TEC-3). Quantitative image analysis was performed using the AxioVision 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss AG); quantitation of immunostainings was determined by counting the number of peroxidase stained cells over the total number of hematoxylin-stained cells.
